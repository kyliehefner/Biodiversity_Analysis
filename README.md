# Biodiversity Analysis

## Scoping
The purpose of scoping a project is to create structure and outline the entire project before beginning. The project outline will be refined as the project goes on. Scoping will allow us to create goals for the project, and ensure that we have the data and analysis tools necessary to achieve those goals.

### Project Goals
The main goal of this project will be to uncover information about the conservation status of endangered species in different national parks. The National Parks Service is looking to identify any patterns in the species that become endangered, and will use this information to protect at-risk species and improve the biodiversity of their parks.

### Data
- observations.csv contains information about the number of observations of each species in each park. This table has 3 columns with 23,297 rows of data.
- species_info.csv contains information about the category, name, and conservation_status of each species of plant and animal in the national parks. This table has 4 columns with 5,825 rows of data.

### Analysis
Descriptive analysis will be used to explore data of species that are currently endangered or species of concern. Potentially revealing trends between category of species and comparing parks where species are found. Data visualization will be used to portray the findings.
